# Exercises 03.2 - JavaScript logical constructs

### A) dataAnalysis

Write a script that takes a value `n > 0` and after that takes `n` integer values. The program calculates:
* The max and the min value
* The average

The script has to show the result with an alert message and also ont the browser console.

**Constraint**: the input value series must contain only numbers between -50 and 50.

### B) multiple

Write a script that takes three values `a`, `b`, `k`, then the program print on the browser console all values between
`a` and `b` that are multiples of `k`.

---

### C) sumCyphers

Write a script that takes an integer positive value `n` greater than 100. The program prints on the console each cyphers of `n`.

---

### D) toDecimal

Write a script that takes a binary number (only 0 and 1 cyphers are allowed) and converts it into the associated
decimal number. Show the result with an alert message. To iterate on the binary number cyphers treat the number as a string!

>[!TIP]
> **Remember**: the binary number 101 can be converted with the following operation:
> 
> 101 (binary) = 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 5 (decimal)
